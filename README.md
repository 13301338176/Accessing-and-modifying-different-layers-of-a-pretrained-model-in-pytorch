# Accessing-and-modifying-different-layers-of-a-pretrained-model-in-pytorch

The goal is dealing with layers of a pretrained Model like resnet18 to print and frozen the parameters. Letâ€™s look at the content of resnet18 and shows the parameters. At first the layers separately are printed to see how we can access every layer individually.

---print(child)<br>
