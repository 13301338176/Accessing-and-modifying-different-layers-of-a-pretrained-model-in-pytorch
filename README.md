# Accessing-and-modifying-different-layers-of-a-pretrained-model-in-pytorch

The goal is dealing with layers of a pretrained Model like resnet18 to print and frozen the parameters. Letâ€™s look at the content of resnet18 and shows the parameters. At first the layers separately are printed to see how we can access every layer individually.

child_counter = 0<br>
for child in model.children():<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp print(" child", child_counter, "is:")<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp print(child)<br>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp child_counter += 1<br>
